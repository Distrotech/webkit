        Fix for <rdar://problem/4148730> SureSec si#182 safari heap overflow.
        When a table has a really huge rowSpan, Safari used to crash because
        the malloc of the grid for the table failed. This fix just checks for
        the success of the malloc.

        * khtml/rendering/render_table.cpp:
        (RenderTableSection::ensureRows): Return false if the grid resize is not 
        successful.
        (RenderTableSection::addCell): Return early if ensureRows() returned false.
        * khtml/rendering/render_table.h: Make ensureRows() return a bool instead
        of void.

        - Fixed <rdar://problem/4392583> REGRESSION: Reproducible crash while viewing Opera's "why we're better than Safari" site, http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html, in khtml::RenderBlock::nodeAtPoint

        Fix by Darin, reviewed and landed by me.

        * khtml/rendering/render_container.cpp:
        (RenderContainer::updatePseudoChild): Don't have the parent call removeChild, because the child calls parent()->removeChild() on itself in detach().
