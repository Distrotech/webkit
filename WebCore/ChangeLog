        <rdar://problem/4428609> Flash Player 8.0.22 can crash Safari (and WebKit apps)
        with javascript disabled (7015)

        Added a test case, manual-tests/NPN_Invoke.  This is a skeleton of a Netscape
        plugin which uses NPN_Invoke() to call the window.alert() JavaScript function.
        
        * bridge/mac/MacFrame.mm:
        (WebCore::MacFrame::windowScriptNPObject):
        Removed the check Darin added to return 0 when JavaScript is disabled.
        This method cannot return 0, because plugins are not guaranteed to check
        for that.
        Removed my old fix for Radar 4428609 (7015) in favor of a better solution.
        Instead of creating a "dummy" JSObject to represent the window script object
        when JavaScript is disabled, we use the new JavaScriptCore bindings API to 
        create a "no script" NPObject.  This solution is better because it does not
        cause entry into any JavaScript interpreter code.

        Fix for <rdar://problem/4148730> SureSec si#182 safari heap overflow.
        When a table has a really huge rowSpan, Safari used to crash because
        the malloc of the grid for the table failed. This fix just checks for
        the success of the malloc.

        * khtml/rendering/render_table.cpp:
        (RenderTableSection::ensureRows): Return false if the grid resize is not 
        successful.
        (RenderTableSection::addCell): Return early if ensureRows() returned false.

        of void.

        - fix <rdar://problem/4379899> *Panther* REGRESSION (TOT): Scrollwheel doesn't work on frameset pages (5450) 
	and <rdar://problem/4379906> *Pan EU2* 10.4.4 Regression: Seed: scrolling with scrollwheel, trackpad doesn't 
	work for nested framesets at gmail.com

        Basically plug in the TOT fixes for Panther.  Add passWheelEventToChildWidget, but add the event as a 
        parameter - since there's no concept of _currentEvent on the branch, we have to pass the event around.  
        Return true when passing the wheel event to the child widget, since we don't want to send the event on
        to the nextResponder for this case.
