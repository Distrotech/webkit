        - fixed <rdar://problem/4227019> Several 32-byte leaks after choosing pop-up menu at dzone198.apple.com

        Test cases added: none, doesn't affect layout. I did execute run-layout-tests to verify that there
        were no surprises though.

        * khtml/ecma/xmlhttprequest.h:
        use SharedPtr for onReadyStateChangeListener and onLoadListener
        * khtml/ecma/xmlhttprequest.cpp:
        (KJS::XMLHttpRequest::getValueProperty):
        use notNull() instead of testing SharedPtrs against 0
        (KJS::XMLHttpRequest::putValueProperty):
        use reset() to set values of SharedPtrs; eliminate ref()s that had no deref()s
        (KJS::XMLHttpRequest::mark):
        use notNull() instead of testing SharedPtrs against 0
        (KJS::XMLHttpRequest::XMLHttpRequest):
        don't initialize SharedPtrs
        (KJS::XMLHttpRequest::changeState):
        use notNull() instead of testing SharedPtrs against 0
